# PostcodeSearch

📍 How to start the project: 

💛 Step 1: Please pull initial structure file (from main)

💙 Step 2: Each team member creates and works on their own branch. 
For example:
feature/bst-implementation
feature/avl-implementation
feature/minheap-implementation
feature/benchmarking-and-ui 

💜 Step3: Pull Requests & Merging
When we completes a feature, please create a pull request to main.
The rest of the group can review and approve.

💚 Step4: Benchmark 
Once all versions (BST, AVL, MinHeap) are working and merged into main, I'll be working on benchmarking tests.
